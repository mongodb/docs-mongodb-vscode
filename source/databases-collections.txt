Once you :ref:`connect to your deployment <vsce-connect>` using |vsce|,
use the left navigation to:

- Explore your databases, collections, read-only views, and documents.

- Create new databases and collections.

- Drop databases and collections.

View Databases and Collections
------------------------------

When you expand an active connection, |vsce| shows the databases in
that deployment.

- Click the name of a database to view the collections it contains.
- Click the name of a collection to view its documents, schema, and
  indexes.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/close-all-docs-on-exit.rst

View Collection Documents and Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you expand a collection, |vsce| displays the number of documents
next to the :guilabel:Documents label in the navigation panel.

Documents
``````````

When you expand a collection's documents, |vsce| lists the ``_id`` of
each document in the collection. Click an ``_id`` value to open that
document in |vscode-short| and view its contents.

You may edit this single document:

.. include:: /includes/seq-edit-document.rst

To view all of the collection's documents in an array, you can:

1. Right-click a collection.
2. Click :guilabel:`View Documents`.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/document-search-template.rst

Schema
``````

Your collection's schema defines the fields and data types within the
collection. Due to MongoDB's flexible schema model, different documents
in a collection may contain different fields, and data types may vary
within a field. MongoDB can enforce
:manual:`schema validation </core/schema-validation/>` to ensure your
collection documents have the same shape.

When you expand a collection's schema, |vsce| lists the fields which
appear in that collection's documents. If a field exists in all
documents and its type is consistent throughout the collection, |vsce|
displays an icon indicating that field's data type. Hover over the
field name for a text description of the field's data type.

Manage Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your collections's indexes are listed under the :guilabel:`Indexes`
heading. When you expand an index, each index key appears with an icon
designating its type. Index key types include:

- Ascending
- Descending
- Geospatial (2d, 2dsphere, geoHaystack)
- Text
- Hashed

.. note::

   You can open a :ref:`MongoDB Playground <vsce-crud>` pre-configured
   to create an index by hovering over the :guilabel:`Indexes` label
   in the navigation panel and clicking the :icon-fa4:`plus` icon that
   appears.

.. seealso::

   To learn more about MongoDB indexes, see the
   :manual:`server manual </indexes>`.

Create a New Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you create a new database, you must populate it with an
initial collection.

To create a new database:

1. Hover over the connection for the deployment where you want your
   database to exist.

#. Click the :icon-fa5:`plus` icon that appears.

#. In the prompt, enter a name for your new database.

#. Press the enter key.

#. Enter a name for the first collection in your new database.

#. Press the enter key.

Create a New Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new collection:

1. Hover over the database where you want your collection to exist.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Plus` icon that appears.

#. In the prompt, enter a name for your new collection.

#. Press the enter key to confirm your new collection.

Drop a Database or Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   Dropping data from MongoDB is an irreversible process. Take caution
   to only drop data you are sure you want to delete, and backup your
   data as necessary.

   Dropping a database also drops all collections and documents within
   that database.

To drop a database or collection:

1. Right-click the target database or collection.

#. Click :guilabel:`Drop Database` or :guilabel:`Drop Collection`.

#. In the prompt, type the name of the target database or collection.

#. Press the enter key.

Refresh Data
------------

You can refresh a deployment, database, or collection at any time to
re-query your deployment and populate |vsce| with the most up-to-date
data.

To refresh:

1. Right-click the target deployment, database, or collection.

#. Click :guilabel:`Refresh`.
