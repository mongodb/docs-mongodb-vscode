MongoDB Playgrounds are JavaScript environments where you can prototype
queries, aggregations, and MongoDB commands with helpful syntax
highlighting.

MongoDB Playgrounds provide intelligent autocomplete for:

- The Mongo Shell |api|,
- MongoDB operators,
- Database, collection, and field names.

You can save playgrounds in your workspace and use them to
document how your application interacts with MongoDB. |vsce| interprets
files with the ``.mongodb`` extension as playgrounds.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/note-playgrounds.rst

|vsce| splits your Playground window to display the results of your 
Playground in |json| format in the right-side pane labeled ``Playground 
Results.json``. If you disabled split-view, |vsce| displays the 
Playground results in |json| format in a new tab to the right of 
your Playground. You cannot edit the results in the results pane. 
You can save the results to a file. 

Prerequisite
------------

To run a playground, you must connect to a MongoDB deployment using
|vsce|. To learn how to connect to a deployment, see either:

- :ref:`vsce-connect`

- :ref:`playground-connect-to-deployment`

Open a Playground
-----------------

Create a New Playground
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create a new playground from the :guilabel:`Playgrounds`
panel, the |vsce| *Overview* page, or the |vscode| Command Pallette.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Playgrounds Panel
      :tabid: playground-panel

      If you have no saved playgrounds in your |vscode-short| workspace,
      in the :guilabel:`Playgrounds` panel of |vsce|, click
      :guilabel:`Create New Playground`.

      .. figure:: /images/vsce-create-new-playground.png
         :figwidth: 400px
         :alt: Image of Create New Playground button

      If you have saved playgrounds in your |vscode| workspace, click
      the :guilabel:`...` menu icon of the :guilabel:`Playgrounds` panel
      and select :guilabel:`Create MongoDB Playground`.

   .. tab:: Overview Page 
      :tabid: mdboverview

      1. In |vscode-short|, press one of the following key combinations:

         - :guilabel:`Control + Shift + P` on Windows or Linux.
         - :guilabel:`Command + Shift + P` on macOS.

         The :guilabel:`Command Palette` provides quick access to 
         commands and keyboard shortcuts.
        
      #. Find and run the :guilabel:`MongoDB: Open Overview Page` 
         command.

         .. include:: /includes/admonitions/tip-mongodb-command-palette.rst

      #. Click :guilabel:`Create Playground` to open a |vsce| 
         playground pre-configured with a few commands.

   .. tab:: VSCode Command Palette
      :tabid: command-palette

      .. include:: /includes/steps/open-new-playground.rst

Open a Saved Playground
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have files in your |vscode-short| workspace with the ``.mongodb``
extension, |vsce| displays these files in the :guilabel:`Playgrounds`
panel.

Double click a ``.mongodb`` file to open that playground.

Run a Playground
----------------

To run a playground, click the :guilabel:`Play Button` in VS Code's top
navigation bar. Your playground runs against the deployment specified in
your :ref:`active connection <vsce-connect>`.

.. _playground-connect-to-deployment:

Connect to a Deployment from a Playground
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If |vsce| is not connected to a MongoDB deployment, you can
specify a connection string for the deployment you want to run your
playground against.

If you have a playground file open in |vscode-short| and do not have
an active connection, |vsce| displays
:guilabel:`Click here to add connection` at the top of your playground.

.. figure:: /images/vsce-playground-add-connection-btn.png
   :figwidth: 700px
   :alt: Link to add connection from playground

1. Click this link to open the connection string dialog.

#. Enter the
   :manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string/>` for the
   deployment you want to run this playground against.
   
#. Press :guilabel:`Enter`.

#. Run your playground.

.. note::

   When you connect to a deployment through the playground connection
   dialog, that connection is added to your |vsce|
   :guilabel:`Connections` list.

Run Selected Lines of a Playground
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you select a section of your playground, you may optionally run only
the selected portion. You may run either a single line or multiple lines
of your playground.

|vsce| shows the :guilabel:`Run Selected Lines from Playground` link
immediately above your selected section. Click this link to test and
troubleshoot specific lines or sections of your playground.

Log to Console from a Playground
--------------------------------

|vsce| supports the following methods to log messages to the console.
Logged messages appear in the :guilabel:`Output` panel in VSCode.

- ``console.log()``
- ``print()``
- ``printjson()``

Logging to the console can be useful to track the output of certain
commands in your playground, such as results after a particular query or
aggregation.
