MongoDB Playgrounds are JavaScript environments where you can prototype
queries, aggregations, and MongoDB commands with helpful syntax
highlighting.

MongoDB Playgrounds provide intelligent autocomplete for:

- The Mongo Shell |api|,
- MongoDB operators,
- Database, collection, and field names.

You can save playgrounds in your workspace and use them to
document how your application interacts with MongoDB.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/note-playgrounds.rst

Prerequisite
------------

To run a playground, you must connect to a MongoDB deployment using
|vsce|. To learn how to connect to a deployment, see
:ref:`vsce-connect`.

Open a Playground
-----------------

To open a playground and begin interacting with your data:

.. include:: /includes/steps/open-new-playground.rst

Your playground runs against the deployment specified in your
:ref:`active connection <vsce-connect>`.

Run a Playground
----------------

To run a playground, click the :guilabel:`Play Button` in VS Code's
top navigation bar.

.. _playground-connect-to-deployment:

Connect to a Deployment to Run a Playground
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If |vsce| is not connected to a MongoDB deployment, you can
specify a connection string for the deployment you want to run your
playground against.

If you have a playground file open in |vscode-short| and do not have
an active connection, |vsce| displays
:guilabel:`Click here to add connection` at the top of your playground.

.. figure:: /images/vsce-playground-add-connection-btn.png

   :alt: Button to add connection from playground

1. Click this button to open the connection string dialog.

#. Enter the
   :manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string/>` for the
   deployment you want to run this playground against.
   
#. Press :guilabel:`Enter`.

#. Run your playground.

.. note::

   When you connect to a deployment through the playground connection
   dialog, that connection is added to your |vsce|
   :guilabel:`Connections` list.

Run Selected Lines of a Playground
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you select a section of your playground, you may optionally run only
the selected portion. You may run either a single line or multiple lines
of your playground.

|vsce| shows the :guilabel:`Run Selected Lines from Playground` button
immediately below your selected section. Click this button to test and
troubleshoot specific lines or sections of your playground.
