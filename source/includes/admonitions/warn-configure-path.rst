.. important::

   To launch your selected MongoDB shell, you must:

   - Install the shell you want to use, and

   - Configure your machine's ``PATH`` environment variable to include 
     the filepath to your shell binary.

   If you install a new version of your MongoDB shell, you will need to 
   update your ``PATH`` variable to reference the new version.

.. seealso::

   - To install the legacy :binary:`mongo <mongo>`
     shell, see :manual:`The mongo Shell </mongo>`.

   - To install the ``mongosh`` shell and for instructions on 
     configuring your ``PATH`` variable, see 
     `Install the MongoDB Shell <https://docs.mongodb.com/mongodb-shell/install>`__.
