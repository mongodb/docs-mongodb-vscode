.. important::

   To launch your selected MongoDB shell, you must:

   - Install the shell you want to use, and

   - Configure your machine's ``PATH`` variable to include the filepath 
     to your shell executable.

   If you install a new version of your MongoDB shell, update your 
   ``PATH`` variable.

   .. seealso::

      - To install the legacy :binary:`mongo <mongo>`
        shell, see :manual:`The mongo Shell </mongo>`.

      - To install the ``mongosh`` shell and for instructions on 
        configuring your ``PATH`` variable, see 
        `Install the MongoDB Shell <https://docs.mongodb.com/mongodb-shell/install>`__.
