Features
--------

You can use MongoDB for |vscode-short| to:

- Explore your MongoDB Data

- Prototype queries and run MongoDB commands

- Create a Shared Tier |service| cluster using a Terraform template

Vale Test Copy
--------------

We should avoid semicolons; they make sentences hard to understand.

We will avoid future tense in the docs.

Be mindful of proper date format. Don't use 10/31/2023.

Obviously, we should avoid words that imply ease of use.
